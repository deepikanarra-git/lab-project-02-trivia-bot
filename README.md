# 🤖 JavaScript Fun Fact Bot – Lab Project 02

## 📘 Description
This project is a beginner-level JavaScript program that introduces a bot which shares fun facts about its favorite programming language using `console.log()`. It was built as part of my FreeCodeCamp lab practice.

The bot introduces itself, shares its name and location, and then prints three fun facts using string concatenation and variables.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Declaring variables using `let`
- String concatenation with `+` operator
- Using `console.log()` to display output
- Reassigning variable values
- Working with multiple strings in JavaScript

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- HTML (to host the JS script)
- Console (browser DevTools)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
3. Open the **Developer Console**:
   - Chrome: Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+K
   - Edge: F12 → Console
4. You’ll see the bot’s greeting, intro, and all fun facts printed in the console.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to create a bot-style message flow using console output
- The importance of clean syntax and spacing in strings
- Basic JavaScript debugging using the console
